* full stack node js
* p2p and distributed systems

I like using node js and javascript because its a flexible scripting language that can be used well as easily as it can be used badly (like any other language). I don't feek like adding types to it or transpiling it to some other language. I don't think types and the complexity and rigidity it adds makes sense when applied to javacscript makes sense. I am all about robust and well written code but blaming the lack of types is just a bad workman blaming his tools... Erlang doesn't even care about types (its a completely functional language.. functional as is using pure functions and immutable data structures) and its arguably the most resilient thing to write complex software with, albeit a bit tough to get going with initially.

Writing software is hard, lets stand on each others shoulders and not on each others toes! Writing robust software involves understanding architecture. If you need resillient code make sure your not re-writing it all the time. Small imple things are more robust than large complex things.. only lunatics favour untamed complexity. When dealing with boring sequential apps and systems that you have control over you tend to work more sloppily and ignore entropy and bad design.
